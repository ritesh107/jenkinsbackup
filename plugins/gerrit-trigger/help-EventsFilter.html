Filters events that are queued from the gerrit stream events.
<br>
If only a few events are intresting to you and you want to reduce load on the queue, then you can control the filter with this setting.
<br><br>
<b>Warning</b>
<br>
This does not modify the event list in the job configuration view.
If you use an event from that list that is filtered out by this setting then that trigger will not work.

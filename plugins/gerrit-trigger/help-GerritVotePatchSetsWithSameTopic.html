<p>
    If this option is enabled, build notifications and votes will be sent to all patch sets within a Gerrit topic.
    <br><br>
    <b>Drawback with current implementation</b>
    <br><br>
    In order to not overwrite the results the following options should be enabled
    <ul>
        <li>Build Current Patches Only</li>
        <li>Abort new patch sets</li>
        <li>Abort patch sets with same topic</li>
    </ul>
    Otherwise commands are send multiple times to the same patch set in Gerrit.
    <br><br>
    Example:
    <br><br>
    Patch set 1 on Repository A (triggers) -> verify-a<br>
    Patch set 2 on Repository B (triggers) -> verify-b<br>
    <br>
    Both patch sets are combined as a Gerrit topic. If the mentioned options are disabled the feedback will result in:<br>
    verify-a (reports result to) -> Patch set 1 & Patch set 2 (due to isVoteSameTopic: true)<br>
    verify-b (reports result to) -> Patch set 2 & Patch set 1 (due to isVoteSameTopic: true)<br>
    <br>
    The fastest job wins. In this case it could happen that one reports a -1 Verified in the first place and the second one +1 Verified overriding the previous result.

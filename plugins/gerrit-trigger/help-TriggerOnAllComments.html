<p>
    By default the Gerrit trigger plugin filters out comments posted by the
    configured user from the event stream. This means that it is not possible
    to trigger builds on these messages. Setting this option will give access to
    the unfiltered stream.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong> that with this option enabled, it is possible to 
    create infinite loops.  For example, a trigger on a Verified +1 will loop
    infinitally on successful builds.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Also note</strong> that enabling this functionality may impact 
    performance since the number of events that need to be processed can 
    increase significantly.  There will be at least two additional events to
    handle for each triggered build.

    Default is disabled.
